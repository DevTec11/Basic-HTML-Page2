                <p>
                    Blueprint is a vintage shop in the heart of downtown. Located at 613 22nd Street, Denver, CO
                    80205. This shop is a hotspot for fresh pieces that display an array of all over prints, tye-dye,
                    and the more rare grapics. This shop is a heckler for trades, wanting only the best you have or
                    noting at all. Considering the rarity of most pieces they have, they have pretty fair prices and
                    killer bundle deals. This shop also features a barbershop so you can go in get a cut and come out
                    looking fresh with a new fit.

                    vintage. They have a premier Ten Dollar Rack that changes daily and they also give the most "in
                    store"
                    credit of the Big Three. They frequently get slept on pieces so don't hesitate to stop by!

                <h3><i>Support Your Local Vintage Resellers!</i></h3>
                <p>
                    It's good to appreciate your local Goodwills and shops but if you're looking to join the vintage
                    community, support your local resellers too! As a collector, I can vouch for the amount of time it
                    takes just to snag one piece that someone might call a "gem". So if a piece is nice but high in
                    price, I suggest you start hunting for some trades! Keep in mind, they put a lot of time into
                    finding good pieces so they won't be haggled easily, but that doesn't mean not to try! They're good
                    people though so you'll most likely get a good snipe with any one of them!

                <h4>START WEARING VINTAGE!</h4>
                <p>
                    When asked if you wear vintage, most people assume I mean tattered clothes and hand me downs. In the
                    modern wave, we're trying to set the bar to be focused on local resellers rather than live auctions.
                    One thing's forsure, you'll spend less. Meaning you'll be able to hunt more or buy more, keeping the
                    works of wearable art preserved; rather than landfilled. There's always enough vintage to go around!
                    Thank you for following me on this journey!
