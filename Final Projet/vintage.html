                    The fashion industry waste is one of the leading contributors to climate change and pollution. The
                    only way we can combat this is to stop buying new, generic stuff and start shoping vintage! It's
                    just one of the many ways we can do our part to stop climate change. This one might be some work but
                    it's well worth it, so give it a try and see what you find! Don't forget to start with the map I
                    gave you! Look fresh while helping the world my friends!

                <h3><i>Support Your Local Vintage Resellers!</i></h3>
                <p>
                    It's good to appreciate your local Goodwills and shops but if you're looking to join the vintage
                    community, support your local resellers too! As a collector, I can vouch for the amount of time it
                    takes just to snag one piece that someone might call a "gem". So if a piece is nice but high in
                    price, I suggest you start hunting for some trades! Keep in mind, they put a lot of time into
                    finding good pieces so they won't be haggled easily, but that doesn't mean not to try! They're good
                    people though so you'll most likely get a good snipe with any one of them!

                <h4>START WEARING VINTAGE!</h4>
                <p>
                    When asked if you wear vintage, most people assume I mean tattered clothes and hand me downs. In the
                    modern wave, we're trying to set the bar to be focused on local resellers rather than live auctions.
                    One thing's forsure, you'll spend less. Meaning you'll be able to hunt more or buy more, keeping the
                    works of wearable art preserved; rather than landfilled. There's always enough vintage to go around!
                    Thank you for following me on this journey!
